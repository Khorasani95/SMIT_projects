    <h3>Semantic Elements</h3>
    <p>When building web pages, we use a combination of non-semantic HTML
       and Semantic HTML.The word semantic means "relating to meaning",so
       semantic elements provide information about the content between the 
       opening and closing tags.<br><br>
       By using Semantic HTML, we select HTML elements base don their
       meaning, not on how they presented.Elements such as <div> and 
       <span> are not semantic elements since they provide no content as to what is
       inside of those tags. <br><br>
